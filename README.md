# SaverBot

SaverBot is a twitter bot that helps people save tweets that they want to.

## How to use?
- Go to https://twitter.com/saverbot1 and follow the bot, so that it can send you DMs easily
- When you find any tweet that you like, just reply to the tweet with `@saverbot1 save` and the tweet will be messaged to you personally in minutes!
- That's it! that's all there is to it, simple, Straight Forward!

Note: Currently, it doesn't matter what is written after @saverbot1, the bot only checks for mentions, however, we encourage u to continue sending the save commmand too as it might be implemented in a future update!
